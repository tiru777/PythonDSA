```Algorithm: 
To solve a problem writing steps is called algorithm

Ways to solve the problem:
-----------------------------------
Problem ==> imagine ==>>Algorithm==> implimentation
Problem ==> imagine ==>>Algorithm==> flow chart==>implimentation

properties of algorithm to implement
-------------------------------
- zero or more inputs required
- one or more outputs required
- must terminate finite solution
- must be efficient
- must be deterministic
```
```Time and space complexity
Time complexity:
----------------
- how much time required to complete the statement
    Asymptotic Notations
    ----------------------
    - Big-O Notation: O(n)
    - Omega Notation: W(n)
    - Theta notation: 0(n)
- All these programms are classified into three types
    - worest case complexity
    - average 
    - best 
- Compleixty in one word means: just loop or iterations
O(1) -- COnstant Time
O(n) -- linear time
O(logn) -- logarithmic time
O(n logn) -- logarithmic time
O(n^2) -- Quardratic Time
O(2^n) -- exponential time
O(n!) -- factorial Time
